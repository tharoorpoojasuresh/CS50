1.  New data types are available from <stdint.h> header which are also defines in the <inttypes.h> header.
2.  They are thet exact-width integer types which are guaranteed to have the same n number of bits throughout.
3.  BYTE=1 BYTE, WORD=2 BYTES, DWORD=4 BYTES, LONG=4 BYTES.
4.  The firat two bytes represent the file type. It should be BM.
5.  bfSize denoted the size in bytes, of the bitmap file.biSize denotes the number of bytes required by the structure.
6. If biHeight is negative,the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount is the field that denotes the depth of the color i.e, bits per pixel.
8.  It returns NULL if the file names are not provided in the arguments or if the filenames provided cannot be opened.
9.  the third argument in fread is always 1 because the fread reads from file only for one time.
10. The value assigned will be 3.
11. fseek sets file position.
12. SEEK_CURR is used to move to the current position of the file.
